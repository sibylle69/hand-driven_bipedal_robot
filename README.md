# hand-driven_bipedal_robot
Code received by the robot from the glove via **radio transmission**. Second year solo project, finished to a high level and exceeded all expectations from the teaching team.

We all learned how to count on our hands. My idea was to use this natural behaviour to develop childrenâ€™s cognitive skills in an interactive and playful way. In fact, a new study recently suggested that children should count on their fingers to learn maths, and proved that using hands when counting is an important part of learning maths. Therefore,  a hand-driven walking robot has been developed and integrated into a game to help kids learn maths while having fun. Its mechanism relies on a set of gears linked by belts and driving both legs with a single motor driven by Radio transmission from a connected glove that **interacts directly with the kid** through a screen placed on the smart glove. The game teaches additions by requesting numbers and checking the kid's answers by sensing the number of fingers displayed by the child. The key attributes of this solution are its high modularity and low cost.
